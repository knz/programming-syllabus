===========================
 “Programming” - Overview
===========================

Course structure
================

At the end of the course, you will gain knowledge and practical skills
around the following general *themes*:

- *abstraction*: from syntax and semantics to types to classes;
- *encoding logic*: from values to variables to expressions to functions to objects;
- *accepting stream input*: from simple text to formatted fields to files to multi-dimensional data;
- *producing stream output*: from simple text to formatted fields;
- *accepting interactive input*: from a command-line interface to event-driven programming;
- *producing graphical output*: using simple pre-defined APIs;
- *inductive programming*: from loops to arrays to recursion.
- *Java language*: standard built-in types, ``String``, ``Scanner``, ``PrintStream``;

The lectures do not cover each theme in turn; instead, each lecture
introduces new concepts in multiple themes simultaneously. This is
necessary, because some knowledge from many themes simultaneously is
necessary to complete even the most simple programming tasks.

The rythm of the lectures and the order concepts are introduced are
dictated by the graded assignments from the separate Instruction
Manual (which you must have readily available, downloaded from
BlackBoard).
