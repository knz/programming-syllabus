<h1>History and motivation</h1>
<p>Internally computers execute instruction one after another, and
manipulate raw bits of data in memory. The addition of names,
functions, variables etc in programming language is meant to <em>help
programmers to do their job better</em>, not the computer.</p>
<p>When the first computers were built, the people in charge of designing
programming languages started with very simple features: variables,
arrays, procedures. All the entities named in a program existed side
by side, so <em>programmers had to choose a different name for every new
entity</em>. This early requirement that all names must be different
wasn't a problem initially, when there were only few entities in a
computer. However as software engineering matured, software became
more and more complex and it became difficult for human programmers to
keep track of the names of everything.</p>
<p>In order to create a more productive structure for programmers,
computer scientists in the 1970's have invented a new way to think
about programs.</p>
<p>In their view, programmers should imagine that they are writing code
for a large collection of many micro-computers, where each
micro-computer would only perform a very simple task with very few
variables.  This way, it was thought, the human programmer could do a
better job, because on each of these micro-computers the programmer
could focus on performing only one task, and doing it well.</p>
<p>Also,
because each of these micro-computers would have its own procedures
and variables, the programmer did not need to invent new names all the
time: <em>the same name could designate different things</em> on different
micro-computers. Using this abstraction, a large software application
can be built by connecting multiple such micro-computers together in a
network and sending messages between them.</p>
<p>For example, this was very powerful to write programs that simulate
traffic on the road: one would program a micro-computer to simulate
the behavior of one car, then another for another car, and so on, then
one micro-computers per road segment, and each could be programmed
separately. In two different cars, the same variable name “speed”
could be reused to designate each car's speed. The messages between a
“car” micro-computer and a “street” micro-computer would be “the car
has entered this streed” or “the car has left this street”. With this
simple composition, the entire program could then imitate a complex
traffic situation, and each individual part could be very simply
implemented without requiring the programmer to know about the complex
whole.</p>
<p>As it so happens, this idea was very successful. Programming in this
way did indeed increase the productivity of programmers and enable
more complex applications that worked with fewer errors.</p>
<p>The micro-computers in this story are what are now called <em>objects</em>: a
<em>small unit of behavior</em> in a large computer system with its own
variables and procedures, and <em>where names can have a local meaning
which differs across different objects.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="object-oriented-languages">
<h1>Object-oriented languages</h1>
<p>A programming language is said to be “object-oriented” when it
promotes thinking in terms of objects when writing code. A further
distinction is made between:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>languages that <em>support object orientation as an opt-in feature</em>,
where programmers can ignore object orientation when starting to
write code, and only use objects in some cases; this is the case for
most programming languages, including C, C++, Python, PHP, OCaml, Matlab,
R;</li>
<li>languages that are <em>exclusively object-oriented</em>, where a programmer
can only write code in terms of objects; this is the case with e.g.
Smalltalk and Java.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, <em>an introductory course on programming should not use a
language that is exclusively object-oriented</em> because it forces a
teacher to talk about objects before talking about more important
topics, like task decomposition, typing, etc. However, perhaps
unfortunately, your education program requires us to start with Java,
so you need to start caring about objects right now, next to the
other topics which are independent from objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="starting-with-java-s-objects">
<h1>Starting with Java's objects</h1>
<p>Because programmers usually write complex programs that do not use
only one object, but rather many of them side by side, it is more practical
to express in program code <em>how an entire family of objects should behave</em>, instead
of writing the same code over and over for every object.</p>
<p>This generalization is so important that all object-oriented languages
are designed with this in mind. So the primary construct in the
language is not the object, but rather <em>the set of all possible
objects that belong to the same family</em>. This set is then described in
code as a <em>class</em>.</p>
<p>In other words, a <em>class is a type which describes a set of all
possible objects that share a common behavior</em>. For example in the
traffic simulation mentioned above, “car” is a class, which describes
the behavior of every possible car in a general way.</p>
<p>We will see more of objects and classes in a later lecture;
for now you can simply remember that a class is defined in Java  using the following construct:</p>
<p><em>Class definition</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">class</tt> &lt;identifier&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">{</tt></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><sub>[</sub></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><sub>[</sub> &lt;variable/attribute declaration&gt; <sub>]*</sub></div>
<div class="line"><sub>[</sub> &lt;function/method definition&gt; <sub>]*</sub></div>
</div>
<div class="line"><sub>]*</sub></div>
</div>
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">}</tt></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>(The keyword “<tt class="docutils literal">class</tt>”, followed by an identifier, followed by an
opening brace, followed by zero or more variable and/or method
definition(s), followed by a closing brace)</p>
<p>Semantics: this construct defines a class named by the identifier
at the top, so that all objects created in this class have
their own copy of the variables but share the same method code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code java literal-block">
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Car</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">mass</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">speed</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w">

     </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">accelerate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">force</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">double</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">timeDelta</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>The variables defined inside a class are called <em>attributes</em>. The
procedures or functions defined inside a class are called <em>methods</em>.
The previous <tt class="docutils literal">Car</tt> example has two attributes <tt class="docutils literal">mass</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">speed</tt>
and one method <tt class="docutils literal">accelerate</tt>.</p>
<p>Attributes are “inside” every object created from the class: two
different objects will have two different sets of variables.</p>
<p>The “methods” are connected to the idea of exchanging messages between
objects as explained above: an object can “send” a message to another,
and this will cause the execution of the corresponding method on the
target object. The general construct for this is defined as follows:</p>
<p><em>Method invocation:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<blockquote>
&lt;expression&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">.</tt> &lt;identifier&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">(</tt> <sub>[</sub> &lt;expression&gt; <sub>[</sub> <tt class="docutils literal">,</tt> &lt;expression&gt; <sub>]*</sub> <sub>]?</sub> <tt class="docutils literal">)</tt></blockquote>
<p>(An expression, followed by a dot <tt class="docutils literal">.</tt>, followed by a name,
followed by an opening parenthesis, followed by zero or more
expressions separated by commas, followed by a closing parenthesis)</p>
<p>Semantics: evaluate all the expressions, then send a message to the
object identifed by the first expression, that causes the
procedure/function named by the name in 2nd position, inside the
object class, to be called on the target object, with the remaining
expressions as input arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="code java literal-block">
<span class="n">out</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>This evaluates first “<tt class="docutils literal">out</tt>”, which designates an object of class
<tt class="docutils literal">PrintStream</tt>; then sends a message to the object <tt class="docutils literal">out</tt> which causes its
method <tt class="docutils literal">println</tt> to be called with one argument, the string “hello”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="program-start-up-and-execution-order">
<h1>Program start-up and execution order</h1>
<p>There is a clear advantage to programming languages that are not
exclusively object-oriented: it is easy to understand where the
program starts. It is quite simple: the first line in the program text
is typically the first thing that runs when the execution begins.</p>
<p>This simplicity implies that a programmer can literally write the
code in the same order it will be run, which makes the task
of a beginner programmer quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not possible in languages that are exclusively
object-oriented: the first line of a program there typically has
nothing to do with program execution, but rather the definition of
classes.</p>
<p><em>So how does Java, for example, know where the program starts?</em></p>
<p>The rule is quite simple: Java will look at all classes defined
in the application (there may be more than one), and <em>searches
for a class which has a special method called “main”</em>. If
none is found, the program cannot start; if one is found,
the execution starts there.</p>
<p>This method is “special” because it must be introduced
in a very specific way, which is waaaay more complicated
than most the  “regular” functions/procedures  you will
ever use in your own programs:</p>
<pre class="code java literal-block">
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">HelloWorld</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">

     </span><span class="kd">public</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">static</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">main</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">String</span><span class="o">[]</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
         </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w">
     </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>We will explain the “<tt class="docutils literal">public static void</tt>” and the “<tt class="docutils literal">String[]</tt>”
later; for the time being, just remember that “main” must always have
this specific form.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-summarize">
<h1>To summarize</h1>
<p>Objects and classes will be presented in more details in a later lecture.
For the time being, <strong>just remember the following</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>because you are using Java, your entire program must be structured
using classes;</li>
<li>a class begins with “<tt class="docutils literal">class</tt> YourName <tt class="docutils literal">{</tt>” and ends with
“<tt class="docutils literal">}</tt>”, <em>this will be mandatory in all your Java code</em>;</li>
<li>all variables and function/procedures in Java must be part of a
class, written within the braces;</li>
<li>at least one class in your program must have a “<tt class="docutils literal">main</tt>” method,
with a fixed form constrained by the language.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="important-concepts">
<h1>Important concepts</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>programming languages exist to help programmers, not computers;</li>
<li>choosing many different names is hard;</li>
<li><em>objects</em> define small unit of behavior in a large system;</li>
<li>object orientation was successful because thinking in terms
of objects decreases the naming problem and simplifies
the definition of complex programs;</li>
<li>the difference between object orientation as an opt-in feature (most languages)
and exclusive object orientation (Java, Smalltalk, a few others);</li>
<li>a <em>class</em> is a common definition for a family of objects;</li>
<li><em>attribute</em> = variable inside a class;</li>
<li><em>method</em> = function/procedure inside a class;</li>
<li>in Java all program behavior must be part of a class;</li>
<li>there must be a “main” method somewhere.</li>
