<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1">Motivations for the art of programming</a></h1>
<p>There exist two main reasons why people write programs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>to automate tasks, so the tasks can be performed by a computer or
robot instead of a person; this is called <em>software engineering</em>;</li>
<li>to create structure in human thoughts, so the thoughts can be
checked more thoroughly by other people or by computers, this is
called <em>formalization</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A programmer writing programs can be motivated by either of these
reasons or both simultaneously. Meanwhile, <em>different programming languages exist
that are better suited to one or the other</em> of these activities.</p>
<p>Historically, most programmers have first been interested in
automation, so the largest number of courses, tutorials, programming
languages and software utilities is dedicated to support learning and
practicing software engineering. For example, <em>Java is a programming
language that was designed expressely for software engineering</em>, and
the ecosystem of Java programming tools helps in this direction.</p>
<p>However, there exists also a world of programming where practitioners
are primarily interested in writing equations that externalize how
people think, so they can write down their abstract ideas formally and
share them precisely with others. <em>Only few people practice this
formalization activity, but a lot of their ideas have proven very
powerful to software engineers: they often make the task of software
engineering simpler and more efficient, and they provide concepts that
can be reused directly across many programming languages.</em> Although
this course focuses primarily on software engineering and Java, I will
sometime refer to such formal concepts, especially those that can be
reused across multiple programming languages.</p>

<div class="section" id="this-is-a-program">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2">This is a program</a></h1>
<p>Let us consider the following Python program (<tt class="docutils literal">Max.py</tt>):</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">

</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Maximum is &quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">m</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre>
<p>A program in a language like Java or Python is like a recipe book: any
part of it describes a <em>sequence of steps</em> to perform. In the case of
this example, there is one such step per line in the first 3 lines;
then a line with the special word <tt class="docutils literal">while</tt> which indicates to
<em>repeat</em> the next 3 lines multiple times. When the repetition is
completed, the step described in the last line is performed.</p>
<p>Such a high-level explanation is sufficient to get a general
intuition, but a more careful analysis is needed to get a <em>precise</em>
understanding of what this program does.</p>
<div class="section" id="syntax-and-semantics">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3">Syntax and semantics</a></h2>
<p>The text of a program, also called its <em>code</em>, is composed of words and
punctuation. There are three types of words in every language:
<em>keywords</em> are words reserved by the language that have always the
same meaning; <em>identifiers</em> or <em>names</em> are words that are freely
chosen by a programmer to <em>designate</em> abstract values or things; and
<em>literal strings</em> are words that represent themselves.</p>
<p>How does one distinguish keywords from identifiers? Text editors will
often automatically recognize keywords and give them a different
color, like in the example above. Usually, a programming language only
has very few keywords so it is possible to learn them by heart.</p>
<p>For example, in the program above, “<tt class="docutils literal">while</tt>” is a keyword, “<tt class="docutils literal">len</tt>” and
“<tt class="docutils literal">print</tt>” are identifiers chosen by programmers whom you likely haven't met,
“<tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>”, “<tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>” and “<tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>” are identifiers chosen by myself, and
“<tt class="docutils literal">&quot;Maximum is&quot;</tt>” is a literal string that represents the text “Maximum is”.</p>
<p>The meaning of a program, also called its <em>semantics</em>, is given by
rules in the programming language. The <em>semantic rules</em> in a
programming language are rules that <em>associate a general meaning to
every program fragment that use a particular syntax form</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-semantic-rules">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4">Example semantic rules</a></h2>
<p>To start, the language Python has a semantic rule that looks like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><em>Assignment</em>:</p>
<p>Syntax: &lt;identifier&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">=</tt> &lt;expression&gt;</p>
<p>Semantics: a statement of this form, when encountered during execution,
will assign the value of the expression on the right side of “<tt class="docutils literal">=</tt>” to
the <em>variable</em> designated by the name on the left side. If the variable
does not exist yet, it is created automatically.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using this rule, we can give meaning to a construct like “<tt class="docutils literal">m = 0</tt>”:
when this line is reached during execution, the value 0 is assigned to
the variable designated by <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>. Since no such variable exists yet,
it is created at that point. Likewise, for “<tt class="docutils literal">i = i + 1</tt>”: when this
line is reached during execution, the value computed by <tt class="docutils literal">i + 1</tt> is
stored in the variable designated by <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>, which was created by <tt class="docutils literal">i =
0</tt> a few steps earlier.</p>
<p>What is a variable? <em>A variable is a location in the computer's memory where
you can store values.</em> In most cases, variables can be modified: the value
stored “in the variable” can be changed by the program over time. Changing
the value of a variable is what is called an “assignment”.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Most languages designed for software engineering have at
least one construct to perform assignments to variables, ie. change
their value. The family of all programming languages that provide
variables and assignments is collectively called “imperative
languages”. Python and Java are such imperative languages.</p>
<p class="last">In Java, the syntax for assignments is the same as in
Python: a name followed by a single “<tt class="docutils literal">=</tt>” followed by an
expression. It has a slightly different semantics however: the
variable is not created automatically by an assignment in Java; it
must be defined separately, using a separate construct which will
be described later.</p>
</div>
<p>The other semantic rules that are key to understand the example program above are:</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first"><em>Addition</em>:</p>
<p>Syntax: &lt;expression&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">+</tt> &lt;expression&gt;</p>
<p>Semantics: the expressions on both sides are first evaluated; the
value of the combined expression is the result of adding the value
of the expression on the left side to the value of the expression
on the right side.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Comparison</em>:</p>
<p>Syntax: &lt;expression&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;</tt> &lt;expression&gt;</p>
<p>Semantics: the expressions on both sides are first evaluated; the
value of the combined expression is true if and only if the value
of the expression on the left side is strictly lower than the value
of the expression on the right side.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Repetition</em></p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">while</tt> &lt;expression&gt; :</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&lt;block&gt;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Semantics: the block is executed repeatedly as long
as the expression on the first line evaluates to true.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Indexing</em></p>
<p>Syntax: &lt;identifier&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">[</tt> &lt;expression&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">]</tt></p>
<p>Semantics: the expression between the square brackets is evaluated,
then its value is used as index to one element of the array (table)
identified by the name on the left.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Function call</em></p>
<p>Syntax: &lt;identifier&gt; <tt class="docutils literal">(</tt> &lt;expression&gt; <sub>[</sub> <tt class="docutils literal">,</tt> &lt;expression&gt; <sub>]*</sub> <tt class="docutils literal">)</tt></p>
<p>Semantics: when evaluating an expression of this form, first
the expressions between parentheses are evaluated; then the function
designated by the name on the right is invoked using
the value of the expressions between parentheses as input arguments;
when it completes execution, its return value becomes the value
of the entire expression.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The syntax for this last rule uses the notation <sub>[</sub>
<sub>]*</sub> to indicate zero or more repetitions of the syntax
between <sub>[]</sub>. Thanks to this, the rule
applies to both <tt class="docutils literal">len(a)</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print(&quot;Maximum</span> is&quot;, m)</tt>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>Conditional execution</em></p>
<p>Syntax:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><tt class="docutils literal">if</tt> &lt;expression&gt; :</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&lt;block&gt;</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Semantics: the expression is evaluated; then the block is executed
if and only if the resulting value is true.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Rules #2, #3, #5, #6 are the same in Java. Java
also has repetition and conditional execution, however it
has a different syntax for it. This will be described later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="program-decomposition">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5">Program decomposition</a></h2>
<p>Using these  rules, we can <em>decompose</em> the meaning of a program
by <em>recognizing which semantic rule apply to each syntax form</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the 1st line, by rule #1, is an assignment; it creates a variable
called “<tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>” and assigns the table of 6 values <tt class="docutils literal">[1.55556, 3.2123,
3.11, 1, 0, 2]</tt> to it.</li>
<li>the 2nd line, by rule #1, is also an assignment; it creates a
variable called “<tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>” and assigns the value 0 to it.</li>
<li>the 3rd line, by rule #1, is also an assignment; it creates a
variable called “<tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>” and assigns the value 0 to it.</li>
<li>the 4th line to the 7th line, as a whole, are a repetition due
to rule #4. The block formed by lines 5-7 is repeated
as long as the expression <tt class="docutils literal">i &lt; len(a)</tt> evaluates to true.</li>
<li>the form <tt class="docutils literal">i &lt; len(a)</tt>, is a comparison due to rule #3; it
compares the current value of the variable designed by <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> to
the value of <tt class="docutils literal">len(a)</tt>.</li>
<li>the form <tt class="docutils literal">len(a)</tt> is a function call due to rule #6; it
invokes the function <tt class="docutils literal">len</tt> on the value of the variable
named <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt>, which is the table of 6 elements. As the Python
documentation then reveals, <tt class="docutils literal">len</tt> returns the number
of elements in the array, so it is always 6 in this program.</li>
<li>the 5th and 6th lines, together, are a conditional execution due to
rule #7. It evaluates the condition <tt class="docutils literal">m &lt; a[i]</tt> then executes <tt class="docutils literal">m =
a[i]</tt> if and only if the condition is true.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">m &lt; a[i]</tt> is a comparison as per rule #3. See above.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">a[i]</tt> is an indexing as per rule #5; it retrieves the element
in the array/table named <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> at the position indicated by <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">m = a[i]</tt> is an assignment as per rule #1. See above.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">i = i + 1</tt> is an assignment as per rule #1. See above. In turn it
uses <tt class="docutils literal">i + 1</tt> which is an addition as per rule #2.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print(&quot;Maximum</span> is &quot;, m)</tt> is a function call as per rule #6.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the program is decomposed, we can reconstruct its overall meaning
by reading aloud the meaning of the individual lines:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>create a variable <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> and set it to the table of 6 values;</li>
<li>create a variable <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt> and set it to 0;</li>
<li>create a variable <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> and set it to 0;</li>
<li>repeat steps 5-7 below as long as <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> is strictly smaller than 6:</li>
<li>if <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt> is strictly lower than the item in <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> at position
<tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>, then do step 6; otherwise go directly to 7;</li>
<li>set <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt> to the item in <tt class="docutils literal">a</tt> at position <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt>;</li>
<li>set <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> to the sum of the (previous) value of <tt class="docutils literal">i</tt> and 1;</li>
<li>print the text “Maximum is ” followed by the value of <tt class="docutils literal">m</tt>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you recognize it? This example program computes the maximum value in
the table of 6 values.</p>
<p>This intellectual step where you recognize the overall meaning of a
program fragment from a step-wise, piecemeal decomposition is called
<em>reverse-engineering</em>. This task is not easy initially, but it becomes
easier with practice. Also, in many cases the programs you will read
will contain comments and annotations by their original writer, to
help you understand the program code.</p>
