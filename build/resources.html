<h1>Syllabus</h1>
<p>The syllabus for the course is structured as a series of short
documents like this one. The <a class="reference external" href="index.html">index page</a> provides a list of all the
documents in the syllabus. <strong>Keep a bookmark to the index page and
refer to it for self-study before and after each lecture.</strong></p>
<p>The following typography rules apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">terms in <em>italics</em> are important concepts which you must thoroughly understand.</p>
<p>“Understand” in this context means you must know the concept from
the top of your head, and you must be able to explain it in your own
words to someone else.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">terms in <strong>bold</strong> are instructions to follow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignment-manual">
<h1>Assignment manual</h1>
<p>All the programming exercises for which you will receive grades are
described in a comprehensive “Instruction Manual” that can be
downloaded from BlackBoard. <strong>Download a copy of this document and
keep it ready at all times.</strong></p>
<p>The instruction manual in turn refers to example input files
for the programming assignments. These files can also be
downloaded from BlackBoard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-books">
<h1>Course books</h1>
<p>The other documents in this syllabus will make references to the
following books:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Allen B. Downey - Think Java: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist.</p>
<p>Download for free at: <a class="reference external" href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/">http://greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">David J. Eck - Introduction to Programming Using Java, 7th Edition.</p>
<p>Download for free at: <a class="reference external" href="http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/">http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Walter Savitch - Absolute Java, 5th Edition,</p>
<p>Addison-Wesley, 2012. ISBN 978-0-13-283031-7.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The references will be given with page numbers referring to the
printed form or PDF document. <strong>Keep a bookmark to these books.</strong>
Ensure you use the printed form or PDF document instead of the HTML
“web page” format for the first two books.</p>
<!-- note: The book “Absolute Java” is the traditional book advised for
the “Programming” course given at VU amsterdam. I find this book
OK, although due to its high price, I will never require my
students to acquire a personal copy. It is possible to complete the
course successfully using other books as well. -->
</div>
<div class="section" id="software">
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>This is a programming course so you will be expected to write and run
programs. For this two main tools are necessary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a <em>language compiler and/or interpreter</em> to run your programs, and</li>
<li>a <em>text editor</em>, which you will use to write your programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programs are written in a <em>programming language</em>. As with natural
languages, there are different programming languages.  This particular
instance of the course chiefly uses the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29">Java</a> programming
language. The language compiler and other tools for this
language are contained in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit</a> (JDK). You
must obtain and install a copy of this.</p>
<p>Many text editors exist and are adequate for this course. Except for
the first two modules, the practical assignments do not require you to
use a particular text editor -- you can decide for your own. For
example, I personally use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, although the assistants may
recommend you to use <a class="reference external" href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-programs">
<h1>Example programs</h1>
<p>During my lecture I develop and explain example programs
interactively. These can be subsequently viewed and downloaded from
the following address:</p>
<blockquote>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>In this part you have learned:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>which documents are involved in this course;</li>
<li>the existence of the instruction manual and where to obtain it;</li>
<li>the title of the 3 books referred to in the lectures;</li>
<li>which software you must obtain and use;</li>
<li>where to find the example programs.</li>
